## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory

• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance

• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights

• Pest/disease detection via image uploads

• Market price tracking

• Voice support for low-literate users

• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Government of Punjab

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution

Farmers will use a mobile app or chatbot that works in their own local language
The app will give farmers information about:

• Which crop to grow

• Soil health and fertilizer use

• Weather updates

• Pest and disease control

• Market prices

The app will talk to farmers in voice so even those who cannot read or write can use it easily
The system will use smart AI technology to:
Guess the best crop for higher yield
Find diseases in crops using photos
Suggest the best farming practices to increase income and reduce costs.
## Technical Approach
Frontend - html,css,javascript

Backend  - Django (Python) or Node.js (JavaScript)

Database - PostgreSQL or MySQL

AI/ML Models

Language Support

Cloud Hosting- AWS / Google Cloud / Azure

## Methodology / Process Flow

Farmer logs in (selects language)
Provides soil, crop, or photo input
System fetches weather + soil + market data
AI engine processes inputs → generates advisory
Farmer receives recommendations via text, voice, or chatbot
Feedback stored → model retrains for better accuracy
